# EcoDAS-scicomm-survey-analysis
This repository contains the code used to analyse the data for the science communication chapter of the 2014 EcoDAS.

Unfortunately, this repository DOES NOT CONTAIN THE DATA since the survey data contains personal information. Please get the data from Elisha's email and put it in the main working directory for this project (_e.g._ C:/.../EcoDAS-scicomm-survey-analysis)

> WARNING: when commiting triple check that you are not uploading sensitive personal information to the repository! (_i.e._ add the data file to .gitignore)
